To fulfill the requirements of this task, you will need to modify your implementation from Task M1.T1P to
use interrupts instead of adding your code to the Loop function. If you have done this already in Task1.1P,
please just resubmit your program here under this task name - i.e. Task1.2P.
As discussed in the lecture, interrupts give you the chance to handle high-priority inputs without having
to wait for the system to finish the current task (if the current task is higher priority we might need to
switch interrupts off until it is done).
In your implementation, you will need to review Arduino Interrupts here
(http://playground.arduino.cc/code/interrupts). I also recommend watching this Youtube video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J61_PKyWjxU). The first 10 minutes is all what you need to get this
done.
