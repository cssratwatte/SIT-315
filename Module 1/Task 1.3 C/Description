To fulfill the requirements of this task, you will need to modify your board from Task M1.2P to use more
than one sensor as input while using interrupts to deal with the inputs.

In my implementation, I used the sound sensor available to me in the Arduino kit. It has four legs - from
left to right as follows [A0 - Analog Pin 0 on the Arduino board, GND, + to 5V, and D0 - Digital Pin to
maybe Arduino digital pin , we had the motion sensor connected to pin2]. Once you have the sound
sensor connected, you will need to modify your program to capture the signal and maybe update the
same led (built-in led) or update another led. Once you are done, please upload to the board and test
your program.
