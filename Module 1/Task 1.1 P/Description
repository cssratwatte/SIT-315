Overview of the task
To fulfill the requirements of this task, you will need to design a simple sense-think-act system using Arduino
board that uses one of the sensors available to you to sense - e.g. temprature, motion, sound, etc. Then think -
update your system status - e.g. motion flag on/off. Finally, act using one of the available actuators for you - e.g.
turn a led on/off. Make sure to print the inputs (from the sensors) and outputs (from the actuators) on the Serial
so we can monitor this from the Arduino IDE.
In my implementation, I used motion sensor HC-SR505 as input and built-in led as output.
HC-SR505 has three legs: from left to right (front facing), the legs are: 1) GND - connect to the GND pin on the
Arduino board , 2) Digital Output connect to digital input pin 2 on the Arduino board), and 3) + to the 5V pin on
the Arduino board.
In your loop function, make sure to digitalRead from pin 2 (where the motion data comes in), check the value
HIGH or LOW, then update the led by using digitalWrite.
Once you are done, please upload to the board and test your program.
